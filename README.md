# Data Visualization Essentials with Power BI

This repository contains the project work from the **Data Visualization Essentials using Power BI** course by [Foresight BI & Analytics](https://training.foresightbi.com.ng/courses/data-visualization-essentials-with-power-bi). The course provides foundational knowledge on using Power BI to create impactful visualizations and build interactive dashboards for data-driven decision-making.

## Course Overview

In this course, I learned how to utilize Power BI to analyze and visualize data from various sources, transform raw data into insightful reports, and build dashboards that provide real-time insights. By the end of the course, I gained the skills to:

- **Import and clean data** using Power Query.
- **Design interactive visualizations** including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and maps.
- **Create dynamic dashboards** with slicers and filters for deep data exploration.
- **Share and publish Power BI reports** to collaborate with stakeholders.

## Key Features of the Project

- **Data Import & Transformation**: Imported raw data from different sources and applied necessary transformations for analysis.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Built a comprehensive dashboard for tracking key business metrics such as revenue, transactions, and product performance.
- **Data Visualizations**: Created various visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and more to represent different aspects of the data.
- **Filters & Slicers**: Added slicers for users to filter the data based on categories like date, location, and product type.
